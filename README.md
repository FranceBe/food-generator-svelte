# Food Generator Svelte

It is a projet to try [SvelteJs](https://svelte.dev/).
I wanted something "easy" to start with, but I still wanted to see how it's possible to use a SvelteJs front-end with a Node/Express Back-End server. So, I decided to re-use the concept of my React Project [what-are-we-gonna-eat-tonight](https://github.com/FranceBe/what-are-we-gonna-eat-tonight).
The Express server is pretty much the same, I'm only interrested in this all new Front-End :).
